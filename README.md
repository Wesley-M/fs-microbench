# fs-microbench
A simple filesystem microbenchmark I used some time ago (now, adding the code to its own repo)

I'll add the proper acks for any code I borrowed as soon I find the original sources (e.g I remember I used threading? code from Zev Weiss and people made public for the "Root: Replaying multithreaded traces with resource-oriented ordering" paper)
